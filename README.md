## Introduction

This project is a Tetris game developed in C# using the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) framework. It aims to provide a classic Tetris gaming experience with a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- Tetris gameplay with standard controls
- Hold and next block features
- Score tracking
- Game over detection

## How to Play

Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move and rotate the falling Tetris blocks. Additional controls include:

- **Spacebar or Enter:** Drop the block to the bottom.
- **Right Shift or C:** Hold the current block for later use.

The goal is to clear as many rows as possible by forming complete horizontal lines.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Tetris.git
   ```

2. Open the solution file (`Tetris.sln`) in Visual Studio.

3. Build and run the project.

## Usage

Launch the game, and use the keyboard controls to navigate and play Tetris. The game's user interface should provide information about the current score, next block, and held block.
